Configuration script supports only g++ and icc.

To install the CADNA library, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.
Some examples:
./configure CXX=YourC++Compiler 
./configure --prefix=TheInstallationDirectory
./configure --enable-64bit
./configure CXX=YourC++Compiler  --prefix=TheInstallationDirectory --enable-64bit

The version of CADNA for OpenMP codes differs from the one for sequential codes.
To generate a version of CADNA for OpenMP codes, use "enable-omp".
Example:
./configure CXX=YourC++Compiler  --prefix=TheInstallationDirectory --enable-64bit --enable-omp

Then 
make install

Then, to compile and execute some test examples, just do:
cd examples
make clean 
make

Example: compilation of a code named ex.cc with CADNA version X.X.X
If ex.cc is a sequential code:
g++ ex.cc -I/home/.../cadna_c-X.X.X/include -L/home/.../cadna_c-X.X.X/lib -lcadnaC -m64 -frounding-math
If ex.cc is an OpenMP code:
g++ ex.cc -I/home/.../cadna_c-X.X.X/include -L/home/.../cadna_c-X.X.X/lib -lcadnaC -m64 -fopenmp -frounding-math

CADNA has been successfully tested with:
- g++ version 5.3.0 for sequential and OpenMP codes
- icc version 15.0.2 for sequential codes.
  Compiling CADNA for OpenMP codes with icc version 15.0.2 generates an error 
  because OpenMP reductions are not supported by icc version 15.0.2.
